# Map of cystic fibrosis mechanisms

The following approach is used to develop a map of the cystic fibrosis mechanisms. Information from literature is integrated into a large-scale Activity Flow diagram. Particular focus is on various types of mutations of CFTR gene. Information from pathway databases, for example Reactome and PANTHER, is reused when possible, and contextualised. The network is presented in the Systems Biology Graphical Notation (SBGN) standard. A community of domain experts is involved to ensure that the disease mechanisms are adequately represented.
