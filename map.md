# Map of cystic fibrosis mechanisms

To the development of the cystic fibrosis map mechanisms the information from literature is integrated into a large-scale Activity Flow diagram. Particular focus is on a specific mutation in the CFTR gene, F508del, the most common mutation in CF patients. Information from pathway databases is reused when possible, and contextualised. The network is presented in the Systems Biology Graphical Notation (SBGN) standard. A community of domain experts is involved to ensure that the disease mechanisms are adequately represented.
