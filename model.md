# CyFi-MAP - A Cystic Fibrosis Disease Map

CyFi-MAP consist on a high-quality diagram of the known described mechanisms involved in Cystic Fibrosis (CF) to elucidate the underlying molecular and cellular events.
All information included is retrieved from literature and databases. CF experts are involved in the curation and accurate representation of the map.
This disease map is divided into two submaps: wild type CFTR (wt-CFTR) and the most common mutant F508del-CFTR.


The main objectives are:

- To archive molecular mechanisms and biological pathways reported to be relevant to CFTR.

- To visualize CFTR pathways in protein cycle processes.

- To understand and be able to follow the main differences between both submaps.


What does allow:

- Search a protein in the CyFi-MAP to be able to see if its described.

- Check pathways and interactions location-specific inside the cell.

- Comment and suggest information to be included in the CyFi-MAP.
