# Model of cystic fibrosis

A computational model of cystic fibrosis is based on the CF-MAP reconstruction. Hypothesis and assumptions are added on the top of the known described mechanisms.

The goal is to develop a computational model of molecular mechanisms which are affected in cystic fibrosis and to quantitatively elucidate the underlying molecular and cellular events.

The objectives are:

1. Integrate the published â€˜omics data for a broader view of CF allowing for an integrated perspective of the available knowledge which will include the relevant molecular interactions. This will involve bringing together the available data in a flexible information system that is able to encompass the relevant information and metadata. 

2. Construct a logical model network from the available data using Bayesian or Markov model.

3. Test and stress the developed model so that it is possible to make an inference by changing and modifying the model inputs. Results will be verified against available experimental data and new essays will be proposed to validate the model consistency.
