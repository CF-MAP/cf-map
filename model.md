# Model of cystic fibrosis

The goal of this project is to develop a computational model of molecular mechanisms which are affected in cystic fibrosis and to quantitatively elucidate the underlying molecular and cellular events.

The purpose of the project is threefold.

In the first place, to integrate all the available â€˜omics resources for a broader view of CF allowing for an integrated perspective of all the available knowledge which will include the relevant molecular interactions and all the relevant regulatory pathways. This will involve modeling the available data in a flexible information system that is able to encompass all the relevant information and metadata gathered from the available resources. Information from literature on disease mechanisms will be integrated into a large-scale model. Pathway information from available databases (for example Reactome, PANTHER) will be contextualised and reused where possible. The network will be presented in the standard Systems Biology Graphical Notation (SBGN) languages. A community of domain experts will be involved in order to ensure that all the relevant disease hallmarks are adequately represented. The resulting network will be made available online as a reference resource for the molecular mechanisms involved in CF.

Secondly, a logical model network will be constructed from the available data; this model may encompass a Bayesian or Markov model.

The third part will involve testing and stressing the developed model so that it is possible to make an inference by changing and modifying the model inputs. Results will be verified against available experimental data and new essays will be proposed to validate the model consistency.
